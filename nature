Wildlife traditionally refers to undomesticated animal species,but has come to include all plants, fungi, and other organisms that grow or live wild in an area without being introduced by humans.[1]

Wildlife can be found in all ecosystems. Deserts, forests, rain forests, plains, grasslands and other areas including the most developed urban areas, all have distinct forms of wildlife. While the term in popular culture usually refers to animals that are untouched by human factors, most scientists agree that much wildlife is affected by human activities
there are so many things in life.
